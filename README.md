## THE MOST ADVANCED WRAPPER, THE FIRST AND UNIQUE WRAPPER IN INTERNET HAVING 5.1 TRANSCODING. YOU WILL HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE CODEC USING THE CONFIGURATOR TOOL INTO THE INSTALLER.

# Wrapper for VideoStation and DLNA MediaServer for DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD with 5.1 support:
Synology VideoStation and MediaServer FFmpeg (and GStreamer) Wrapper with DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD support. It enables hardware transcoding from Synology´s ffmpeg for video and transcoding DTS, HEVC, EAC3, AAC, True HD from the ffmpeg of the SynoCommunity. When you use this SynoCommunity´s ffmpeg, you will have AAC 5.1 512kbps Surround and another audio track MP3 2.0 256kbps Stereo for Chromecast or GoogleTV or other clients that don´t accept 5.1 AAC.


Works fine the OffLine transcoding and the streaming of tipical extensions like: MKV, MP4, AVI... Works fine the thumbnails in VideoStation.

This wrapper is a fork of BenjaminPoncet rev.12 with a some changes, fixes and some improvements in his code.

# VideoStation and DLNA MediaServer FFMPEG-Wrapper, now with Installer and Codecs CONFIGURATOR: 

This installer is designed to simplify the installation steps and enable **DTS**, **EAC3** and **TrueHD** support to Synology VideoStation and MediaServer by replacing the ffmpeg binary files by a wrapper using SynoCommunity ffmpeg, (only when It´s necessary).
You will can change the order of the audio codecs in the Wrapper, install the most Advanced Wrapper with 5.1 or the Simplest one, patch DLNA MediaServer and VideoStation, all in the SAME Installer.

The Installer has Multi Language support (English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian).

# Now the Installer has the AME's License Fix: 
This enables the AAC and HEVC codecs and its license in the AME package, until DSM 7.2.
This patcher enables Advanced Media Extensions 3.0 for you, without having to login account. When you install this License's patch, the Wrapper must be uninstalled and you must to re-install it again.
This is not mandatory to have it installed for installing the Wrapper.

*(Use at your own risk, although it has been done to be as safe as possible, there could be errors. (Crack for XPEnology and Synology without AME's license).*

## Dependencies:
- DSM 7.0-41890 (and above)

- DTS or EAC3 or TrueHD or AAC + HEVC: ✅
